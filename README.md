Spino-Runner: This is a game developed by me using the Copilot neural network in Python.
Everything in the game is developed using a neural network - Pictures, sounds, controls, interface. All of this was done by Copilot.
This game is, of course, not the final version. In the future, I am going to make the models clearer, add settings, allow the user to change the screen resolution, etc.
This game is good because it is developed in Python, which allows you to run it on absolutely any microwave, and also, it has an open source code. This means that you can change everything that comes to your mind
If you have any ideas about what can be added, write in the discussions, I will read everything!

Digression - I'm new to GitHub, and I don't understand how things work here at all, so if anyone wants to help a newbie, write to email (yushindima88work@gmail.com) or telegram (@Crossmen_Life88)

Instructions on how to play are in the file.

Good luck to everyone!

P.S. - Hello Microsoft!
